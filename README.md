#skilltree: coming soon

Build your own skill tree similar to [DungeonsAndDevelopers.com](http://www.DungeonsAndDevelopers.com).

###Check back soon

I'm busy making the code more portable. Hang in there!

###Building skilltree.min.js

The */src* folder contains a file called *build.js*. You can use a compiled like [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) or [Prepos](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/) to build this to *dist/skilltree.min.js*. (You will probably need to alter the output path.)

###Demos
The */demos* folder contains */dungeons-and-developers*, which is probably what brought you here. I've split it out with the (future) intention that you'll be able to use the skilltree script independendently for your own project, and even add your own to the demos folder, if you wish. 

**Please do, I'd love to see what you make!**
